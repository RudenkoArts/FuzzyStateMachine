Implementation of Fuzzy State Machine (FuSM) in ActionScript 3.0 for creating game AI/bot/agent.

It's a state machine that can run several states at the same time.
Unlike FSM, because of the machine can run more than one states at the same time, FuSM doesn't have any transition.
A state in FuSM use a Degree of Membership or DOM (I borrow the term from Fuzzy Logic), a value thats hold the degree of state activation. 
DOM value is a Number between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 if state is inactive, and 1.0 if the state is fully activated.
